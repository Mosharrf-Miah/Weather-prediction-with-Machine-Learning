# Weather prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Summary
ClimateWin are a non-profit organisaation based in Europe who are extremely concerned with the change in climate and increase in extreme weather condition over the 10-20 years. Using historical data from 18 different weather stations across Europe to create a machine learning alogrithm which will predict future weather conditions.
