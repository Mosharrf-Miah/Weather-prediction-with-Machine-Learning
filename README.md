# Weather prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Summary
ClimateWin are a non-profit organisaation based in Europe who are extremely concerned with the change in climate and increase in extreme weather condition over the 10-20 years. Using historical data from 18 different weather stations across Europe to create a machine learning alogrithm which will predict future weather conditions.

## Key Questions

1. How is machine learning currently used, and is it applicable to weather data?

2. Are there any ethical concerns specific to this project, beyond general issues with AI and machine learning?

3. What are the historical temperature extremes?

4. Can machine learning predict weather conditions on a given day?


## Data 

18 weather stations across Europe. The weather stations have been collecting data from the late 1800s to 2022. The dataset includes daily values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation.


## Tools
1. Python
2. Powerpoint
